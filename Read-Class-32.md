# Permissions & Postgresql
## What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions are a set of built-in tools provided by the Django Rest Framework that allow you to control access to your API endpoints. They play a crucial role in securing your API by determining who can perform certain actions on the resources exposed by your API.

The key components of DRF permissions are:

1. Permission classes: DRF provides several permission classes that define the rules for accessing API endpoints. These classes are used to check whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.

2. Request: When a client makes a request to an API endpoint, DRF examines the request to determine the user making the request, along with the associated authentication and authorization credentials.

3. User: The user making the request is identified based on the provided authentication credentials. This can be an authenticated user or an anonymous user.

4. Authentication: DRF supports various authentication schemes such as token-based authentication, session authentication, OAuth, etc. The authentication scheme is responsible for verifying the identity of the user making the request.

5. Authorization: Once the user is authenticated, authorization comes into play. Authorization determines whether the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource or perform the requested action.

## In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table or tables. It is the most commonly used statement in SQL and allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, the table(s) from which to retrieve the data, and any conditions or filters to apply.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SELECT statement:

```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

## Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
DRF (Django Rest Framework) provides a set of powerful tools and abstractions to simplify the process of building RESTful APIs. One of the key components of DRF is Generic Views. Generic Views are pre-implemented views provided by DRF that encapsulate common functionality required for CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

The role of DRF Generic Views is to abstract away common implementation patterns and reduce the amount of repetitive code needed to build API endpoints. They provide a simplified and consistent way to handle common actions on resources, such as retrieving a single object, listing objects, creating objects, updating objects, and deleting objects.
