# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Basic Recursion
Basic recursion is a programming concept that involves a function calling itself. It's a powerful technique used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems of the same type. Recursion can be used to solve a wide range of problems, from calculating factorials to traversing complex data structures. However, it can also lead to performance issues if not implemented carefully.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we can use a base case to terminate the recursion. A base case is a condition that, when met, stops the recursive function from calling itself. It's essential to ensure that the base case is reachable from the recursive calls and that it's not overlooked or incorrectly defined.

## Data Structures
Data structures are essential tools for managing and organizing data in a program. They are used to store and manipulate data efficiently, and to implement algorithms and other program features. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right one can significantly impact the performance and functionality of a program.

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
When deciding which data structure to use for a particular problem, one of the most important considerations is the efficiency of the operations that will be performed on the data.

## Big O 
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the complexity of an algorithm or a program. It's used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity. The notation expresses how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that the runtime grows linearly with the size of the input. Big O notation is a critical tool for designing and optimizing algorithms and programs.
