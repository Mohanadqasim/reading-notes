## What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

1. Communication: The importance of communication becomes evident when the candidate starts working on the whiteboard. Any misunderstandings could prevent the candidate from accurately completing the whiteboard exercise, potentially leading to longer problem-solving times. Therefore, it is essential to ask specific questions about the requirements.

2. Ask About Edge Cases: Edge cases are an important aspect of the problem domain. Asking the interviewer about them can greatly impact how the code behaves. For example, inquire about the types of data the function should accept as arguments or how negative numbers should be handled."

3. Ask About Test Cases: Inquiring about test cases can enhance the candidate's understanding of the problem and leave a positive impression on the interviewer. It demonstrates the candidate's thoroughness and desire to ensure the code's correctness.

4. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense: Writing pseudocode can help the candidate understand the problem better and translate the requirements into logical steps. It serves as a helpful guide when converting pseudocode into actual code. Asking the interviewer to review the pseudocode for any logical mistakes provides valuable feedback. If the candidate encounters difficulties in writing the actual code despite having good pseudocode, it demonstrates their ability to break down the problem into smaller pieces and find a solution which is a great advantage.

5. Stuck? Ask for Help!: If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. For example:

    “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
The answer might be “no, I’d like to see if you can solve it from here on your own,” but it also very well might be a “yes” with a useful tip!

## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

1. Take a few minutes to think: It is important to take a moment to gather your thoughts and formulate a plan before jumping into solving the problem. Instead of immediately talking, use the first few minutes to think about the problem, ask clarifying questions, and come up with an approach. This concentrated thought process will help you present a more organized and coherent solution to the interviewer.

2. Write down the steps of the solution: Before starting to write code, jot down the general steps of how you plan to solve the problem. This helps you outline a logical structure for your solution and ensures that you don't miss any crucial steps. By writing down the steps on the whiteboard, you can refer to them during the interview and stay on track. This approach also allows the interviewer to see your thought process and understand your approach more clearly.
