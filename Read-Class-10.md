# Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues are two fundamental data structures used in computer science for organizing and manipulating collections of data.

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements are added and removed only from the top of the stack. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed, a principle known as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). A stack is similar to a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top. Stacks are commonly used in programming for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking.

A queue, on the other hand, is a linear data structure in which elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed, a principle known as First-In-First-Out (FIFO). A queue is similar to a line of people waiting to buy tickets at a movie theater or board a plane. Queues are commonly used in programming for managing tasks that need to be executed in a specific order, such as processing jobs in a print queue, or requests in a web server.

Both stacks and queues are often implemented using arrays or linked lists. In an array-based implementation, a stack or queue is represented as a contiguous block of memory, and elements are accessed using indices. In a linked list-based implementation, a stack or queue is represented as a chain of nodes, each containing a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Overall, stacks and queues are simple yet powerful data structures that are essential building blocks for many algorithms and applications in computer science.
