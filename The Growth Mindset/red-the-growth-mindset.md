# The Growth Mindset
## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice.
Improving your technical skills through deliberate practice is crucial for advancing your career as a software developer. Merely programming every day doesn't necessarily make you better at programming. Deliberate practice pushes you just outside your comfort zone, is repeated often, provides feedback, and is mentally demanding. It is essential to set challenges that teach you something new, rather than building the same things repeatedly. Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind are excellent examples of challenges that can help intermediate to senior developers improve their skills. To become better at programming, you need to step away from your comfort zone and challenge yourself to learn new things continuously.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset. 
Carol Dweck's theory of the two mindsets, growth and fixed, explains the impact of our beliefs on our ability to succeed. In her book "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success," Dweck explains how the growth mindset, which believes that our basic qualities can be cultivated through effort, leads to a passion for learning, resilience in the face of setbacks, and ultimately, success. On the other hand, the fixed mindset, which believes that our qualities are unchangeable, leads to a desire to prove oneself correct, a fear of failure, and limited potential. By changing our beliefs and adopting a growth mindset, we can cultivate our abilities and reach our full potential.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success. 
In his TED talk, philosopher and best-selling author Alain de Botton examines the concept of success and failure, exploring the reasons behind our career-related anxieties. He argues that the desire for social acceptance, the illusion of meritocracy, and envy all contribute to the pressure we feel to succeed. To alleviate this anxiety, de Botton suggests accepting that building a truly meritocratic society is an impossible dream and that luck plays a role in all aspects of life. He also encourages individuals to create their own definition of success, recognizing that we cannot have it all. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of empathy and sympathy in understanding failure and loss.
