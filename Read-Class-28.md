# How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

Django Forms facilitate user input handling by providing a convenient way to handle form validation, data cleaning, and rendering HTML forms. They simplify the process of receiving and processing user input, handling form validation errors, and saving data to the database. Some key components of creating a form using the Django framework include defining form fields, specifying validation rules, rendering the form in HTML templates, and handling form submissions in views.

# Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.

Django Templates in web development serve the purpose of separating the presentation logic from the business logic. They provide a way to define the structure and layout of web pages using HTML, combined with Django's template language. Template inheritance is a powerful feature that allows developers to create a base template with common elements and then extend it to create specialized templates for specific pages. This approach improves code reusability and maintainability by avoiding repetition and making it easier to make changes across multiple pages.

# Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

Django Views handle HTTP requests and define the logic for processing those requests. They receive a request from a user's browser, perform the necessary actions, and return an appropriate response, such as rendering a template or redirecting to another page. Function-based views are written as Python functions and are simpler and easier to understand. Class-based views, on the other hand, are defined as Python classes and provide additional features such as reusable mixins and built-in methods for handling different HTTP methods. Class-based views are more powerful and flexible, especially for complex scenarios or when using common patterns.
