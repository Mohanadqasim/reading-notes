I have found the information that these topics offers are so helpful and supportive, Pain Vs. Suffering as an example had me remind myself why I started this course in the first place and prepared me for what is coming in the next 10 weeks, the Big O is very important for the perfomance aspect of coding, Finally now i do know the differnce between mutable and immutable datatypes.



## Pain Vs. Suffering
Learning a programming language such as Python in a short period of time will certainly be overwhelming in several ways in life including but not limited to:
1. Mentally
2. Physically
3. Emotionally

The amount of information we need to know and search about every day is not little at all, and that requires hours and hours of being in front of a computer's screen and handling different types of tasks.

But I will to counter that by doing the following:
1. Keeping myself focused on the final results and reminding myself how every growth opportunity comes with a price, which is 'pain'.
2. Try to Half of the labs work in the same day of the lecture to ease the task.



## Big O
Time complexity is a measurement of how long an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input data set and it is represented using Big O notations such as O(1)/ O(N)/ O(2^N) and so on.

On the other hand,space complexity is used to measure how much memory an algorithm needs for it to run based on the size of the input data and also uses Big O notations to describe it.



## Names and Values in Python
An object whose internal state can be changed is mutable (List, Set, Dictionary..etc). On the other hand, immutable doesn't allow any change in the object once it has been created (tuples, int, float...etc ).
