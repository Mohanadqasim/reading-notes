# What is Serverless Computing?

Serverless refers to a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and dynamically allocates resources as needed, relieving developers from the burden of managing servers and infrastructure scaling. Serverless computing, often referred to as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), is a specific implementation of serverless architecture.

In a serverless computing model, developers write and deploy small, event-driven functions that perform specific tasks. These functions are executed in response to triggers or events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or scheduled events. The cloud provider takes care of automatically scaling and managing the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing the code for their functions.

Serverless functions are designed to be stateless and ephemeral, meaning they do not maintain persistent connections or store state between invocations. Each function execution is independent, isolated, and short-lived. The cloud provider handles the execution of the function, allocates the necessary resources, and ensures that the function is highly available and scalable.

Serverless functions are typically billed based on the actual usage, measured in terms of the number of invocations and the resources consumed during each invocation, such as CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth. This pay-per-use pricing model makes serverless computing cost-efficient, as you only pay for the actual usage rather than for idle resources.

Overall, serverless computing offers benefits such as simplified infrastructure management, automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, and cost optimization. It has gained popularity for building scalable and event-driven applications that can respond quickly to changing demands.
