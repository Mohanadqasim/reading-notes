I have found these articles very informative and reading them helped me to make more clear idea about them. in  a short paragraphs here is what i came up with from reading these articles:

## Linked Lists
Linked Lists are a popular data structure in computer programming used to store a sequence of elements, where each element contains a reference to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists can dynamically grow and shrink in size, making them ideal for situations where the size of the data is not known beforehand or needs to be modified frequently.

## Big O 
Big O is a mathematical notation used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. It provides a way to express the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input. The notation uses O followed by a function of n, where n is the size of the input. The function represents the upper bound of the growth rate of the algorithm's time complexity as the input size grows.

In summary, linked lists are a data structure used to store a sequence of elements, while Big O is a mathematical notation used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.
