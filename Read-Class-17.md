# What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?

The key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites are:

1. Structure: Static websites have fixed HTML pages that remain the same unless manually updated, while dynamic websites generate content dynamically using client-side scripting or server-side technologies.

2. Content Accessibility: Scraping static websites is generally easier since the content is readily available in the HTML source code. In contrast, dynamic websites require rendering or executing JavaScript code to obtain the desired content.

3. Interactivity: Dynamic websites often include interactive elements that require user input or interaction. Scraping such websites may require additional steps to simulate user actions or handle JavaScript events.

4. Data Retrieval: Scraping static websites involves parsing the HTML source code directly to extract the desired data. On dynamic websites, additional techniques like executing JavaScript code, interacting with APIs, or monitoring network traffic may be necessary to retrieve the data.

5. Maintenance: Static websites are relatively stable as their content rarely changes, so scraping them may require less maintenance. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, may undergo frequent updates or redesigns, requiring regular adjustments to the scraping process.

6. Scalability: Scraping static websites can be more scalable since the content is pre-rendered and readily available. Scraping dynamic websites may require more resources and time due to the need for rendering and executing scripts.

# Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.

To avoid getting blocked while scraping websites, here are three techniques or best practices:

* Respect website's robots.txt: Review the website's robots.txt file to understand any restrictions or guidelines for scraping. Adhering to these rules can help avoid being blocked.
* Use delays and timeouts: Introduce random delays between requests and simulate human-like browsing patterns. Additionally, set appropriate timeouts to prevent excessive requests that may trigger blocking mechanisms.
* Rotate user agents and IP addresses: Vary the user agent string in your scraping requests to mimic different browsers or devices. Additionally, consider using a pool of IP addresses or proxies to distribute requests and avoid being detected as a single source.

# What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.

Playwright is a tool that assists in web scraping tasks by providing a high-level API for automating web browsers. It allows you to automate interactions with web pages, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and extracting data, making it easier to scrape websites. An example use case for Playwright would be scraping an e-commerce website to extract product information, where you need to navigate through different pages, interact with elements, and extract data.

# Describe the purpose of using Xpath in web scraping, and provide an example of an Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element from a webpage.

Xpath is a language used to navigate and select elements in an XML or HTML document. In web scraping, Xpath helps locate specific elements within the page's structure. An example Xpath expression to select a specific HTML element could be:

```
//h1[@class="title"]
```
This expression selects the 'h1' element with the class attribute equal to "title". It will match any 'h1' element with that specific class within the document, allowing you to extract its content or perform further actions.
