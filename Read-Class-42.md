### The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

In this article, Bill Sourour discusses important points related to the ethical boundaries and limits that companies and programmers should adhere to. In his story, he recounts coding a website for a medication company, where the company deliberately omitted certain treatment's side effects, targeting teenage girls as their audience. Tragically, the medication had suicidal thoughts as a side effect, leading a young girl to take her own life due to a lack of awareness about the potential risks of the medication she was taking. The writer expresses profound regret for what happened, even though he was merely doing his job. He emphasizes the importance of new regulations and laws that can prevent similar events from occurring due to companies' greed, as technology continues to exert significant control over almost every aspect of human lives.

### Ethical dilemma of self driving cars

As self-driving technology advances, the ethical debate intensifies. Studies show they can reduce accidents significantly. But who should the car prioritize harming in unavoidable situations? Germany has guidelines favoring human safety. People tend to support a utilitarian approach, but when they're passengers, they want protection. The challenge lies in developing AI for complex decision-making. While concerns persist, experts believe people will adapt, and self-driving cars will offer new forms of human control. Resolving ethical dilemmas is crucial for a safer, connected future on the roads.
