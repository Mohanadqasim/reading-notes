# The key benefits of using a Django Custom User Model are:

- Flexibility: It allows you to define your own fields and methods for the user model, tailored to your project's specific requirements.
- Scalability: It provides the ability to easily add or modify user fields without affecting the existing database schema.
- Customization: You can override or extend built-in Django user model functionalities to suit your application's needs.

# The process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django involves the following steps:

Create a new Django app to house the custom user model.

Define a new model that inherits from AbstractBaseUser or AbstractUser, depending on your needs.

Customize the fields for the user model, such as username, email, or additional fields.

Implement the required methods for authentication and permissions, like get_username(), has_perm(), etc.

Update the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting in the project's settings.py file to point to the new custom user model.

Run database migrations to create the necessary tables for the custom user model.
