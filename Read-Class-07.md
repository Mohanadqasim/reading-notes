# Python Scope

## Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of any function or block of code, and are therefore accessible throughout the program. In contrast, local scope refers to variables that are defined within a specific function or block of code and are only accessible within that function or block.

```
x = 10        # global scope

def func():
    y = 20    # local scope
    print(x)  # accessing x from global scope
    print(y)  # accessing y from local scope

func()
print(x)      # accessing x from global scope
print(y)      # will result in an error, y is not defined in global scope
```

## How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?
The global keyword is used to declare that a variable is in the global scope, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including within functions. If a variable is declared as global within a function, it can be modified and accessed globally.

The nonlocal keyword, on the other hand, is used to access a variable from an outer (enclosing) scope in a nested function. It allows a nested function to modify a variable in the outer function's scope. 

## In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.
In the context of algorithm analysis, the purpose of Big O notation is to describe the complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input. The size of the input is usually denoted by n, and the Big O notation describes the upper bound of the algorithm's growth rate as n approaches infinity.

The importance of Big O notation lies in its ability to provide a quantitative measure of an algorithm's efficiency, enabling us to compare different algorithms and choose the best one for a given problem. A more efficient algorithm will have a lower order of growth in its Big O notation.

Big O notation is a powerful tool for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, enabling us to quantify their complexity and compare their performance for a given problem. It is an important concept in computer science and software engineering, helping developers to optimize code and improve software performance.
