# Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh 

## What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are popular visualization libraries used in Python for creating high-quality data visualizations. While all three libraries can create various types of visualizations, they have different features and use cases.

1. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library that provides a wide range of static visualization options. It is an easy-to-use library and can create basic visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more. Matplotlib is ideal for creating publication-quality graphs and charts, and it is highly customizable.
 
2. Seaborn: Seaborn is a library that is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating beautiful and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is particularly suited for exploring and visualizing complex datasets with many variables. It offers a range of advanced visualization techniques, including heatmaps, pair plots, and regression plots.

3. Bokeh: Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that provides a web-based interface for creating interactive data visualizations. It is particularly well-suited for creating interactive plots and dashboards that can be embedded in web applications. Bokeh offers a range of interactive tools such as hover, pan, zoom, and selection that make it easy to explore data and gain insights.

## In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

In Seaborn library, there are three main categories of plots: relational, categorical, and distribution plots.

1. Relational plots: These plots are used to show the relationship between two or more variables. Some of the popular relational plots in Seaborn are scatter plots, line plots, and joint plots.

2. Categorical plots: These plots are used to visualize the relationship between one numerical variable and one or more categorical variables. Some popular categorical plots in Seaborn are bar plots, count plots, and box plots.

3. Distribution plots: These plots are used to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. Some popular distribution plots in Seaborn are histograms, kernel density estimation plots, and rug plots.
